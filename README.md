# DigitalClock
# Overview
A digital clock is a basic yet essential component of many applications, providing users with real-time timekeeping. This project aims to build a functional and visually appealing digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock will display the current time and update every second, demonstrating fundamental web development techniques and the use of JavaScript for real-time updates.
# Problem Statement
While creating a digital clock might seem straightforward, it involves understanding how to effectively use JavaScript for real-time data updates, as well as CSS for styling and layout. The main challenge is to ensure the clock updates accurately every second and is styled in a way that is visually pleasing and responsive to different screen sizes.
# Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To develop a digital clock that displays the current time accurately.
2. To utilize JavaScript for real-time updating of the clock.
3. To apply CSS for styling the clock, making it visually appealing and responsive.
4. To provide a learning example for beginners in web development, demonstrating the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
